# nexty-common-code

Common code for the nexty project

err - A routine to construct Error objects with messages for both internal and external consumption i.e. messages suitable for end users and more detailed messages and codes for our logging and debugging.

various regexes - Regular expressions for a variety of input validation tasks.

Note: In the unlikely event you want to use any of the code in this package it would be best to fork or copy it. It's for a personal project and it's liable to change at the drop of a hat so I won't be instituting semver til it's stabilised - if ever.
